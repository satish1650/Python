    "## Key Points about Python Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Typing**: Data types in Python are dynamic. This means we can assign different values to the same variable at different points in time, and Python will dynamically change the type of the variable as per the value given.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    a = 5\n",
    "    print(type(a))  # Output: <class 'int'>\n",
    "    a = 'Python'\n",
    "    print(type(a))  # Output: <class 'str'>\n",
    "    a = 3.5\n",
    "    print(type(a))  # Output: <class 'float'>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Size Management**: The size of data types in Python is dynamically managed. Unlike C/C++/Java, variables in Python are not of fixed size. Python makes variables as big as required on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import sys\n",
    "    a = 5\n",
    "    print(sys.getsizeof(a))  # Output: size in bytes\n",
    "    a = 'Python'\n",
    "    print(sys.getsizeof(a))  # Output: size in bytes\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Unbounded Data Types**: Python data types like integers do not have any range, i.e., they are unbounded. Unlike C/C++, they do not have a min or max value. An `int` type can store as many digits as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    a = 10**1000  # a very large number\n",
    "    print(a)\n",
    "    print(type(a))  # Output: <class 'int'>\n",
    "    ```"
