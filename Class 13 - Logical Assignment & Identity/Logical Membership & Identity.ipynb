    "1. The logical operators in Python are `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n",
    "2. Assignment operators in Python are used to assign values to variables. The most common assignment operator is `=`. For example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    a = 10\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. Compound assignment operators combine arithmetic or bitwise operations with assignment. For example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    x = 5\n",
    "    x += 2  # Equivalent to x = x + 2\n",
    "    print(x)  # Output: 7\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "4. Identity operators in Python are `is` and `is not`. They check if two variables refer to the same object in memory. For example:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    a = 10\n",
    "    b = 10\n",
    "    print(a is b)  # True, because a and b refer to the same object\n",
    "    print(a is not b)  # False, because a and b refer to the same object\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5. Python does not have increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators because they are not necessary. Python provides other ways to increment or decrement values, such as `+=` and `-=`.\n",
    "6. Here is a code snippet to demonstrate the use of `is` and `is not` operators with lists:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    x = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    y = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    print(x is y)  # False, because x and y refer to different objects\n",
    "    print(x == y)  # True, because x and y have the same contents\n",
